This program was written using python 2.7.5 on Mac OS 10.9.4.
It can be run from the terminal in the project folder by running "kivy ./main.py"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program creates a main widget from the MovementGame Class. As children of this widget two more widgets are created,
a player widget from the Player class and a pickup item from the PickUp Class.

When a touch event is detected the player object's direction of travel is calculated using the location of the player
and the touch event. The difference between these to locations is calculated, used to create a vector and then that vector
is normalized to and multiplied by 2.5 to give a constant speed.

When a collision is detected between the player and widget pickup item the pickup item is removed from the screen.

The player object moves until its lower left vertex has reached a particular distance from the touch event.

I used code from the PongGame tutorial found on the Kivy homepage. I have labeled the classes and any sources I used within
the programs comments in more detail.

Player Class, was taken from the PongBall Class in the tutorial.
MovementApp class was taken from the App class in the Pong tutorial.
MovementGame was derived from the PongGame class in the pong tutorial but has been modified from my purposes.
